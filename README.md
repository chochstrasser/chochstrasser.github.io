#### Making Changes

1. source branch acts like master branch. So branch away using source, and merge your branches into source as needed.

2. `git push origin source`

3. `git checkout master`

4. `git merge source`

5. `git checkout source`

6. `yarn deploy`

There you go! Those changes are published and deployed.
